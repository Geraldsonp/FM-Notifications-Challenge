## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

While building this. I learned of how importan font-sizes are for have a great layout. I also learned how to properly manage state with react use stateHook to change the state of notifications. 

How to render component dynamicly and apply styles dynamicly.

I got to see how important is to use the right tools for organizing content, I used Grid for the overal layout and flexbox for alignment.

### Continued development
For future projects I would like to keep learning how to properly arrange items and style them.

I really love the chanllenges and would keep on solving them and leaning from them.
